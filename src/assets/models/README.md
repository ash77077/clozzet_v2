## Model Requirements

For best results, your 3D models should:
- Be in GLB or GLTF format
- Have proper UV mapping for textures
- Be centered at origin (0, 0, 0)
- Be reasonable size (will be auto-scaled)
- Have clean topology
- Include basic materials

## Fallback Behavior

If models are not found, the system will automatically use procedurally generated clothing shapes as a fallback. This ensures the application works even without the GLB files.

## Converting Other Formats to GLB

If you have models in other formats (FBX, OBJ, etc.):

1. **Online Converters:**
   - https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion/fbx-to-glb
   - https://anyconv.com/fbx-to-glb-converter/

2. **Using Blender (Recommended):**
   - Open Blender
   - File → Import → Your format (FBX/OBJ)
   - File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb)
   - Save as the appropriate filename

## License Compliance

Make sure any models you download comply with their license terms:
- **CC0**: Public domain, use freely
- **CC BY**: Attribution required (give credit to creator)
- **CC BY-SA**: Attribution + share-alike
- Check each model's specific license before use

## Recommended Models (Examples)

Search these terms on Sketchfab for good results:
- "basic t-shirt"
- "plain hoodie"
- "polo shirt low poly"
- "clothing template"

Happy modeling! 🎨
